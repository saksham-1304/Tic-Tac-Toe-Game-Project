# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game_Project
<p>This repository hosts a simple <b>Tic Tac Toe Game</b> implemented using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</b> The Game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their respective symbols ("X" or "O"). The objective is to create a winning pattern of three symbols in a row, column or diagonal.</p>
<p><b>Key Features:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Interactive Gameplay</b>: Players can click on the grid cells to place their symbols, with the Game updating in real-time after each move.</li>

<li><b>Win Detection</b>: The Game engine detects winning patterns and declares the winner when a player achieves three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>

<li><b>Draw Detection</b>: If all grid cells are filled without any player achieving a winning pattern, the Game declares a draw.</li>

<li><b>Reset Option</b>: Players have the ability to reset the Game board and start a new Game at any point.</li>

<li><b>Responsive Design</b>: The Game interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.</li></ul>
