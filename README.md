# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game_Project
<p>This repository hosts a simple <b>Tic Tac Toe Game</b> implemented using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</b> The Game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their respective symbols ("X" or "O"). The objective is to create a winning pattern of three symbols in a row, column or diagonal.</p>
<p><b>Key Features:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Interactive Gameplay</b>: Players can click on the grid cells to place their symbols, with the Game updating in real-time after each move.</li>
